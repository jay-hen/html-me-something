    <h1>What it is and Why We Must Fight for it</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>The <em>Mitragyna speciosa</em> plant, commonly known at Kratom, is a tropical evergreen tree related to the coffee tree that natively grows in Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and New Guinea. For hundreds of years the Kratom plant has been used in traditional medicines and in certain regions its leaves were chewed or brewed into tea by local labourers to fend off exhaustion and ameliorate productivity. Kratom also has a detailed history of being used in socioreligious ceremonies and to tend to a variety of medical conditions such as opioid dependence and chronic pain.
        <br><br>
    The main active ingredients in Kratom are the alkaloids <strong>mitragynine</strong> and <strong>7-hydoxymitragynine</strong> both of which are only found in <em>Mitragyna speciosa</em>. The effects of Kratom are dependent on the dose where small doses provide stimulating effects and an improvement in focus and larger doses aid in alleviating ailments such as chronic pain or insomnia. Kratom also helps to combat other maladies those of which include anxiety, depression, and opioid addiction. While Kratom itself contains no opiates it does bind to the same receptors in the brain that coffe, chocolate, and exercise do and its potential for abuse is no greater than that of other herbal supplements such as St. John's Wort or gaurana.

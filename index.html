        <h1>Kratom</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>A Short Introduction</h2>
        <br><br>
        <article>
            <p class="info">The <em>Mitragyna speciosa</em> plant, commonly known at Kratom, is a tropical evergreen tree related to the coffee tree that natively grows in Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and New Guinea. For hundreds of years the Kratom plant has been used in traditional medicines and in certain regions its leaves were chewed or brewed into tea by local laborers to fend off exhaustion and ameliorate productivity. Kratom also has a detailed history of being used in socioreligious ceremonies and to tend to a variety of medical conditions such as opioid dependence and chronic pain.</p>
                <br><br>
            <p class="info">The main active ingredients in Kratom are the alkaloids <strong>mitragynine</strong> and <strong>7-hydoxymitragynine</strong> both of which are only found in <em>Mitragyna speciosa</em>. The effects of Kratom are dependent on the dose where small doses provide stimulating effects and an improvement in focus and larger doses aid in alleviating ailments such as chronic pain or insomnia. Kratom also helps to combat other maladies those of which include anxiety, depression, and opioid addiction. While Kratom itself contains no opiates it does bind to the same receptors in the brain that coffee, chocolate, and exercise do and its potential for abuse is no greater than that of other herbal supplements such as St. John's Wort or caffeine.</p>
                <br><br>
            <p class="info">While U.S. government agencies warn against the side effects of Kratom claiming it to induce hallucinations and psychosis studies continue to be released that further prove this to be untrue. The DEA continues to push to place the alkaloids of the <em>Mitragyna speciosa</em> plant under a schedule I classification, but due to push back from the community and enlightenment from recent studies full federal scheduling of the ingredients has not been implemented. In some areas the supplement is not legal on the state level, but organizations such as the &quot;American Kratom Association&quot; continue to encourage citizens to speak out against this practice.</p>
                <br><br>
            <p class="info">If Kratom were to be made illegal on  the federal level, scientifically studying it would become nearly impossible. This plant could help save thousands of lives stuck in the throes of the opioid crisis that American citizens face (from which 130 people die everyday). In order to get to that point, however, U.S. citizens need to <a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative">reach out to their representatives</a> and give their opinions on keeping this beneficial supplement legal.</p>

    <h1>Kratom</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>What it is and Why We Must Fight for it</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>The <em>Mitragyna speciosa</em> plant, commonly known at kratom, is a tropical evergreen tree related to the coffee tree that natively grows in Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and New Guinea. For hundreds of years the kratom plant has been used in traditional medicines and in certain regions its leaves were chewed or brewed into tea by local labourers to fend off exhaustion and ameliorate productivity. Kratom also has a detailed history of being used in socioreligious ceremonies and to tend to a variety of medical conditions such as opioid dependence and chronic pain.
        <br>
    The main active ingredients in kratom are alkaaloids <strong>mitragynine</strong> and <strong>7-hydoxymitragynine</strong> both of which are only found in <em>Mitragyna speciosa</em>.
